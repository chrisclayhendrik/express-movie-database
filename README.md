Express Movie Database A (tiny) database of my top 5 favorite sci-fi movies!

This is a project completed in conjunction with my software engineering bootcamp at Multiverse.

My Kanban board screenshot and ERD are located within the files of this repository.



To get started, cd into the src directory, and run node seed.js to seed the database.

You should then cd into the server directory, and run node server.js to launch the app. 

Routes include /movies, /movies:id, /cast, /cast:id, /crew, /crew:id

Unit testing can be run by cd into test and then running npm run test and npm run test:report


Thank you for taking the time to view my basic web app.
